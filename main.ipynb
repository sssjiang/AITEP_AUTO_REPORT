      "        \"Absorption\": \"Myrtol standardized is absorbed almost completely into the body, with its main components being absorbed about 100%. The enteric coating of Myrtol capsules prevents rapid absorption, leading to a plateau-like phase of plasma concentrations.\",\n",
      "        \"Distribution\": \"There is limited specific information available on the distribution of Myrtol in the body. However, its active components, such as monoterpenes (d-limonene, 1,8-cineole, and alpha-pinene), are likely distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream.\",\n",
      "        \"Metabolism\": \"The metabolism of Myrtol involves the breakdown of its active components. While specific metabolic pathways are not detailed, the presence of metabolites suggests that Myrtol undergoes metabolic processing.\",\n",
      "        \"Excretion\": \"The excretion of Myrtol and its metabolites is not extensively documented. However, given its complete absorption and metabolic processing, it is likely that excretion occurs primarily through the kidneys and possibly the liver.\"\n",
      "    },\n",
      "    \"Indication\": \"Used primarily for respiratory conditions such as acute bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, cough, sinusitis (including acute and chronic rhinosinusitis). Also considered for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its secretolytic and bronchospasmolytic effects. It is often used as an alternative to antibiotics in cases where bacterial infection is uncertain, due to its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.\",\n",
      "    \"Pharmacodynamics\": \"Enhances mucociliary clearance by increasing the production and transport of mucus, reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, helps in breaking down mucus, increases ciliary beat frequency (CBF), and has antibacterial properties.\",\n",
      "    \"Mechanism of Action\": \"Reduces inflammation by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and GM-CSF, and by reducing leukotriene production through 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Captures reactive oxygen radicals, particularly hydroxyl radicals, thereby preventing oxidative cell damage. Inhibits the growth of certain bacteria, enhances mucociliary clearance by increasing mucus production and promoting ciliary beat frequency, and relaxes bronchial muscles improving airway patency.\",\n",
